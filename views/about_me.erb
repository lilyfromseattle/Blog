<div class="about">

<p>My name is Lily and I'm a student at the Ada Developer's Academy. Welcome to my website! I'm a Seattle native currently plunging headfirst into web design and code. I have a degree in Sociology from the University of Washington with a minor in Philosophy. I have a background in fine art and design of all kinds.

I'm enjoying learning the basics of web development through tutorials like Chris Pine's Learn to Program, Learn Ruby the Hard Way, Team Treehouse, and Codecademy, as well as many others.</p>

<p>Although I find all types of code to be facinating, I am especially drawn to in front-end web development. It gives me a chance to use my graphic design and art background to create dynamic, interactive sites.

I enjoy snowboarding, cooking, crossword puzzles, watching and quoting Arrested Development, and reading essays by David Sedaris. I love art and fashion. I am oil painter who specializes in realism, especially portraits. I love to experiment with sewing my own clothes.

I created this website using HTML and CSS. I used media queries to make a mobile nav, so it looks great on mobile phones as well as computers! This is my blog!</p>
